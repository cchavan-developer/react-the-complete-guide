### What is React.js ?
- Lean and focused component-based Javascript library for building user interfaces.

- Javascript is a programming language that allows us to run logic in browser. You can manipulate HTML structure (DOM) of the page.

- React is a client-side Javascript library, used to build modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.

### Why do we need React.js ?
- React is all about splitting code into small building blocks, custom HTML elements knows as components.

- Code is maintainable and manageable.

### Building SPAs
- SPA (Single Page Application)
    - React can be used to control the entire frontend of a web application.

    - In SPA approach, server only sends one HTML page, thereafter, react takes over and controls the UI.

- MPA (Multi Page Application)
    - React can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages.

     - In MPA approach, some pages are still rendered on and served by the BE server.
